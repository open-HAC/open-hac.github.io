  Why?
</h2>
<p>
  There is an enormous growth in open source hardware/software co-design projects worldwide. The stuff that previously used to be proprietary are now becoming open source. What does this offer? Our students can work on cutting-edge technologies and have international exposure. Working on these projects will help students enormously and will enable them to participate in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) as well. Further this would provide amazing opportunities of internships in companies like Google, SiFive, MERL etc.
