<h1>Welcome to Open Hardware and Computing Society - OpenHAC</h1>
<p>The OpenHAC Society aims to empower students with skills in computing and hardware designing and further involve students to collaborate together and contribute to open source projects or invent your own awesome projects. The aim is to empower students who can then contribute on international open source projects and be able to participate in the Goolge Summer of Code (GSoC) as well as initiate startups by solving any critical problem they think needs to be solved.</p>
<h2>Why do we exist?</h2>
<p>We believe students are the best asset for any country to move forward in terms of technology innovation and improving the economy of a country. Students can innovate at a higher rate as compared to professionals if they are given the freedom. It's their ability to question and reason everything that exists to disrupt the conventional norms. They can think independently and solve problems in a way that has never been done because they don't even know how it's done. It's this immaturity and amateur knowledge that breeds innovation and for this purpose the OpenHAC Society exists. God has made everyone unique for a purpose, let's find it and conquer the conventional norms together and break them and innovate to excel ourselves and our country! <em>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to OpenHAC.</em></p>
<h2>How do we try to achieve our belief?</h2>
<p>Students are taking on an agile journey of processor designing. Within a month they are able to design their own processors and write their own programs on top of it, thanks to the power of RISC-V and Chisel. After the basic pillars developed, students are engaged hands on in different projects and will be encouraged to learn new thing, develop new skills and contribute to open source projects which will enable them to participate in GSoC and open huge opportunities to get internships in companies like Google, SiFive, MERL etc.</p>
<h2>Why now?</h2>
<p>The open source hardware/software co-design for computing is spreading like wildfire all around the world. Every country is researching the possibilities. The technology that used to be proprietary and power was centralized is now broken down and decentralized. Processors can be designed independently, customised to our needs and software applications can be run on top of it with best optimizations. We hope to engage students in projects that are disrupting the proprietary workflows of designing processors and contribute to open source workflows which can enable anyone in the world to design their own chips. Your AI and ML models can be optimised for it. Rather than running AI on raspberry pi or your laptops which are not made for it, run them on a custom hardware made by you!</p>
<h2>Working structure</h2>
<p>At OpenHAC we aim to work on projects broken down into two categories</p>
<ol>
<li>Hardware</li>
<li>Software</li>
</ol>
<p>The amazing thing is these two categories are almost similar. The hardware projects are also automated with software. Member students will be actively working on projects from the above two categories, they'll be contributing to existing projects and more importantly create their own tools where they feel the problem is and an opportunity exists to automate the problem with software. This freedom ensures students learn to innovate.</p></body>
