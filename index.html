  Welcome to Open Hardware and Computing Society - OpenHAC
</h1>

<p>
  The OpenHAC Society aims to empower students with skills in computing and hardware designing and further involve students to collaborate together and contribute to open source projects or invent your own awesome projects. This is a pretty vast domain and almost includes every skillset domian. 
</p>
<p>
  Every initiative starts with a <b>Why?</b> Here is ours:
</p>
<h2>
  Why?
</h2>
<p>
  There is an enormous growth in open source hardware/software co-design projects worldwide. The stuff that previously used to be proprietary are now becoming open source. What does this offer? Our students can work on cutting-edge technologies and have international exposure. Working on these projects will help students enormously and will enable them to participate in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) as well. Further this would provide amazing opportunities of internships in companies like Google, SiFive, MERL etc. 
</p>
<h2>

<p>
  There are no special requirements for elegibility. All students from all the departments are encouraged to become the member of this amzing society. Furthermore, there will be no membership fees and everything is <i>open</i> and <i>free</i> :)
